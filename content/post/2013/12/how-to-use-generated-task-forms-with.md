<div>
I prepared a screencast in which I show how to use the <a href="http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/user-guide/#tasklist-task-forms-generated-task-forms">Generated Task Forms</a> Feature we introduced with camunda BPM 7.1.0-alpha1.<br />
<br />
Generated task forms allow you to create simple task forms without the need to write any HTML code.<br />
<br />
Please also have a look at the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/camunda/camunda-quickstarts/tree/master/usertask/task-form-generated">Generated Task Forms Quickstart</a>.<br />
<br />
I dedicate the first 3 minutes to show you guys how to do the project setup.<b> If you are familiar with setting up a camunda ServletProcessApplication, you can skip ahead to about 3:00 and start there.</b><br />

The camunda BPM platform participated in a somewhat extreme BPMN roundtrip demo of the OMG. During that demo, the camunda engine managed to execute a BPMN process model that we pushed through five different modeling tools. Altogether, eight tools participated in the entire roundtrip. Among them where <a href="http://camunda.org/bpmn/tool/">camunda Modeler</a> for editing BPMN in Eclipse, the <a href="http://camunda.org/">camunda engine</a> for executing the BPMN process and <a href="https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpmn.js">camunda-bpmn.js</a> for rendering BPMN in JavaScript. In addition, I also did a demo of how to use <a href="http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/user-guide/#cycle">camunda Cycle</a> for automating BPMN roundtrips.

## Spring Boot Starter alpha release

As previously announced, the next stable release of Spring Boot Starter will be in May, together with Camunda BPM 7.9. This Spring Boot Starter 3.0.0-alpha1 version comes with the recently released Spring Boot 2.0.0. ([Camunda Spring Boot Starter repository](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-spring-boot-starter))

## Payload in Signal Events

Signal Events are broadcast to all of the signal-catching Process Instances. This alpha release adds support for payloads in Signal Events. This feature can be used in case you need to pass some addition information (variables or business key) within the signal.
The Signal payload is declared in the Throwing Signal Event Definition. Here is how the XML looks like:

```xml
<signalEventDefinition signalRef="thePizzaSignal">
    <extensionElements>
        <camunda:in source="X" target="Y" />
        <camunda:in sourceExpression="${X + 5}" target="Z" />
        <camunda:in variables="all" local="true" />
        <camunda:in businessKey="${execution.processBusinessKey}" />
    </extensionElements>
</signalEventDefinition>
```
For more details about this feature, please check out the [documentation](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/reference/bpmn20/events/signal-events/#passing-variables).

## Implement Your BPMN Service Task with Node

Now it is possible to handle your BPMN Service Tasks in NodeJS. We already released the second alpha of the Camunda NodeJS External Task Client project and you can read more about it in the previous [blog post](https://blog.camunda.com/post/2018/03/extermal-task-js-alpha2/).

In addition, we have released the first alpha of the [External Task Java Client](https://blog.camunda.com/post/2018/03/camunda-external-task-client-java-010-alpha1-released/) just a week ago.

If you want to dive in deeper, check out the loan granting example of the [NodeJS](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-external-task-client-js/tree/master/examples/granting-loans) and [Java](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-external-task-client-java/tree/master/examples/loan-granting) clients.

We will be happy to receive some [feedback](https://forum.camunda.org/) from you, so don't hesitate to try it and share your thoughts with us.

## What's Next?

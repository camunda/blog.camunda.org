+++

We are happy to announce the Camunda Modeler 2.0 release. The new Modeler ships with major improvements to BPMN editing and another round of minimap enhancements. A brand new properties panel for DMN adds support for Camunda specific properties and allows you to inspect and edit technical DMN properties in one place. Finally, the modeler now ships with signed executables, allowing you to safely employ it, even in locked down, corporate environments on both MacOS and Windows.

The improved BPMN editor allows you model Boundary Event to Activity loops and Activity self-referencing loops in a convenient manner. Additional BPMN editor improvements improvements include, among others, a reworked minimap and better message flow layouting. Checkout the [BPMN changelog](#bpmn) for all noteworthy improvements.

[Download the Camunda Modeler](https://camunda.com/download/modeler/) and start modeling right away.


## DMN Properties Panel

A new properties panel for DMN allows you to inspect and edit technical properties in a single place.

{{< figure class="teaser no-border" src="dmn-properties-panel.png" alt="Inspect and edit DMN technical properties using the properties panel" caption="Inspect and edit DMN technical properties" >}}

The panel is available for all editors (DRD, Decision Table and Literal Expression) and may be toggled open / closed via the menu or a keyboard shortcut.

Using the panel you may edit the name and ID property of DRD and decision elements as well as [Camunda extensions](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.9/reference/dmn11/custom-extensions/camunda-attributes/) such as `camunda:versionTag`. As seen in the screenshot above we dropped the DRD editing overlay. Edit the properties using the properties panel from now on.


## Signing, Installers and More

Starting with this release the Camunda Modeler ships with signed executables for both MacOS and Windows. This makes it possible to run the application without hazzles, even in locked down, corporate environments.

In the future we will provide native installers that make installing and updating the application easier. As a preparation we dropped the automatic in-app file association wiring on Windows.

File associations that previously wired automatically on Windows must now be wired explicitly using scripts provided in the `support` directory. Checkout the [updated installation documentation](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/installation/camunda-modeler/) to learn more.

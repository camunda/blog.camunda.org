+++

We are proud to announce the Camunda Modeler 2.2 release. This release improves the accessibility of all diagram editors, ships a number of important fixes and provides feature parity with Camunda BPM 7.10.


<!--more-->

The diagram editors (BPMN, CMMN, DRD) now allow you to move a selection of elements with keyboard arrows, giving you more pixel-perfect control over how elements should be positioned. Use the arrow keys along with `Ctrl/Cmd` to move the canvas instead. Press the `Shift` modifier to accelerate both element and canvas movement.

[Download the Camunda Modeler](https://camunda.com/download/modeler/) and start modeling right away.


## Accessible Context Pad

The context pad that provides quick access to modeling actions. Starting with this release it is always accessible, even when modeling on very high or low zoom levels.

## Improved Event Based Gateway Modeling

We always strive to be being good in the little things, too. In that spirit, this release improves the modeling of event-based gateways.

## Camunda 7.10 Feature Parity

This version of our modeler adds support for editing [`camunda:isStartableInTasklist`](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/reference/bpmn20/custom-extensions/extension-attributes/#isstartableintasklist), thus providing full compatibility with the upcoming Camunda 7.10 platform release.

In recent months, we’ve seen more and more users building solutions with Camunda BPM to address microservices orchestration challenges. The [external task clients](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.9/user-guide/ext-client/), newly added in version 7.9.0, is one example of how Camunda BPM has evolved to meet user needs in this area.

Camunda is running a survey about microservices orchestration so that we can learn more about how you’re approaching this problem and how Camunda can help. We’d love to hear your feedback.

**[You can submit your response to the survey here.](https://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/4451284/2fe4fb27f1d7)**

Every organization takes a different approach to a microservices architecture, and we want to be sure we have a detailed understanding of what microservices orchestration means to the range of different types of users who are thinking about this problem.

For example, some organizations build _all_ of their applications based on a microservices architecture and have always operated that way, while others have a mix of microservices-based applications as well as applications that rely on some more traditional architecture. Some organizations connect their microservices with an asynchronous, event-driven communication pattern, while others use synchronous, HTTP-based communication.

The survey is open to anyone with interest in this topic! You don't need to be a Camunda user, and you don't even need to be a part of team that's working with a microservices architecture. We still want to hear from you.

After collecting responses, we'll publish a report summarizing the survey results. We'll only include aggregated data in this report–no individual response data.

Here are a few other details:
• The survey will remain open until July 30, 2018.
• It's possible to respond to the survey anonymously if you'd like.
• Almost all questions in the survey are optional, so you can skip questions you prefer not to answer.

As a token of our appreciation, we'll be drawing names of a few respondents to give away free passes to your choice of [CamundaCon 2018 in Berlin](https://camunda.com/events/camundacon/) (our annual user conference) or a [Camunda classroom training](https://camunda.com/services/training/), where you'll learn more about Camunda BPM and BPMN.

We hope to [hear from you](https://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/4451284/2fe4fb27f1d7), and we'll report back once we've analyzed the survey results.

We are excited to announce the next release of the Camunda Spring Boot Starter - version 3.2.0.

An important highlight of this release is the use of **Spring Boot 2.1.1**, which includes support for JDK 11.

<!--more-->
Otherwise, the current release does not implement additional new features.

Camunda Spring Boot Starter 3.2.0 relies on Camunda BPM Platform 7.10 by default. You can find the Upgrade Guide [here](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.10/update/spring-boot-starter/migration-31-32/).
Please take time to check it together with the [Release Notes](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-2.1-Release-Notes) for Spring Boot 2.1.

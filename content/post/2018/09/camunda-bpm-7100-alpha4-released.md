## Extending the BPMN Viewer in Cockpit
BPMN diagrams in Cockpit are rendered and displayed by the [bpmn.js toolkit](https://bpmn.io/toolkit/bpmn-js/). Bpmn.js 
can be extended with additional modules as well as so called moddle extensions. 

An additional module refers to the extension of the feature set, whereas a moddle extension makes it possible to add custom 
attributes and elements to the BPMN 2.0 model.

Starting with this release, it is possible to use the extension mechanism of bpmn.js through Camunda Cockpit to customize 
the default behavior of the BPMN viewer.

To extend the BPMN Viewer, the file `app/cockpit/scripts/config.js` needs to be adjusted as follows:
```javascript
var camCockpitConf = {
  ...
  bpmnJs: {
    additionalModules: {
      // a JavaScript file, which represents a module
      myCustomModule: 'my-custom-module/module'
    },
    moddleExtensions: {
      // a JSON file, which represents a moddle extension
      myCustomModdleExtension: 'my-custom-moddle/moddle'
    }
  }
  ...
};
```

For further information, please see the documentation of [Cockpit](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/webapps/cockpit/extend/configuration/#bpmn-diagram-viewer-bpmn-js)
and [bpmn.js](https://bpmn.io/toolkit/bpmn-js/walkthrough/#extend-the-modeler).

## Support for Java 9 / 10 & 11
Camunda BPM is now on the cutting-edge of Java since this release brings support for Java 9 & 10 as well as for Java 11 
â€“ which has been released just a few days ago.

## What's Next?

The next alpha version is scheduled for the end of October and our team is already working on it.

The minor release of **Camunda BPM 7.10** is coming this fall (November 30, 2018).

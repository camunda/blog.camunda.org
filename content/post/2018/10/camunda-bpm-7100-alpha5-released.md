## Configure Business Key in Delegation Code

Within this alpha we introduce new option to configure the business key. The setting can be done inside delegation code (Execution listener, Task listner or Java delegate implementation). In other words you can configure the business key of already running process instance. Here is an example:
```java
public class SetNewBusinessKeyDelegate implements JavaDelegate {
   public void execute(DelegateExecution execution) throws Exception {
    execution.setProcessBusinessKey("businessKey");
  }
 }
```
You can find more information about the delegation code in our [User guide](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/user-guide/process-engine/delegation-code/#set-business-key-from-delegation-code).
What is a business key? - you can check this [How to Use Business Keys?](https://blog.camunda.com/post/2018/10/business-key/) blog post.

## Fetch and Lock Based on Process Definition and Tenant

The "fetch and lock" mechanism is popular among the users implementing [External tasks](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/user-guide/process-engine/external-tasks). Now you can filter tasks based on two new options - process definition and tenant id. You can find
java example below:
```java
externalTasks = externalTaskService.fetchAndLock(2, "aWorkerId")
      .topic("createOrder", 10000)
      .processDefinitionId("aProcessDefinitionId")
      .withoutTenantId()
      .execute();
```
and here is Rest API example:

POST `/external-task/fetchAndLock`
```json
 {
      "workerId":"aWorkerId",
      "maxTasks":2,
      "usePriority":true,
      "topics":
          [{"topicName": "createOrder",
            "lockDuration": 10000,
            "processDefinitionId": "aProcessDefinitionId",
            "tenantIdIn": "tenantOne"
          }]
  }
```
For more infomation please check the [Rest documentation](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/reference/rest/external-task/fetch/).

## A Single WildFly distro

It's one small step for the Camunda distros, but a pretty giant leap for the Camunda engineering teams. From Camunda BPM 7.10-alpha5, Camunda will only provide a single WildFly distro, always with the latest version of WildFly (currently WildFly 14).

Don't worry, WildFly 8 continues to be supported through a separate `camunda-wildfly8-subsystem` (included with [this](https://app.camunda.com/nexus/content/groups/public/org/camunda/bpm/wildfly/camunda-wildfly8-modules/) archive), while version 10 and above work with the latest `camunda-wildfly-subsystem`. New Camunda BPM users, that wish to use it with WildFly 8 or WildFly 10-13, will need to do a [full manual installation](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/installation/full/jboss/manual/) on the appropriate vanilla WildFly application server.

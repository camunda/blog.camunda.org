## Query for "Startable in Tasklist" Process Definition

Imagine, you have a process, which is referenced from call activity of parent process, or processes with message, signal or conditional start events. Usually, such processes
 are not intended to be started directly, but rather triggered by some internal events. So far, they would still be shown under Tasklist "Start process" menu. 
 Now, with the new process attribute "*isStartableInTasklist*", you can define, whether the process should be startable from tasklist or not.

You can find simple example of a process below:
```xml
<process id="subProcess" 
         name="Process called from Super Process" 
		 isExecutable="true" 
		 camunda:isStartableInTasklist="false">
...
</process>
```

With then new Camunda version, you can query for "startable in Tasklist" processes via Java API or REST API:
```json
GET /process-definition?latestVersion=true&startableInTasklist=true
```
```java
repositoryService.createProcessDefinitionQuery()
        .latestVersion()
        .startableInTasklist()
        .list();
```
"notStartableInTasklist" filter option is available as well.

Stay tuned! In one of the next Alpha releases, the Tasklist will start using this query. 

## Jump to Tasklist link from Process Instance View

Previously we introduced link from Tasklist leading to the Process Instance View in Cockpit.
The new link can be used if you navigate to Process Instance (Runtime) View and open the User task panel.
Then you can easily navigate to the respective task in Tasklist. Simply click on the Task ID.

The improved minimap allows you to drag the viewport anywhere in the modeler. It also comes with improved zooming similar to the zooming on the canvas. Last but not least, we've added a button that lets you minimize the minimap if you don't need it.

Download the Camunda Modeler from [camunda.com](https://camunda.com/download/modeler/) and start modeling right away.

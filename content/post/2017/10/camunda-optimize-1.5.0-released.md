# Great Things are Coming

The next major version of Camunda Optimize is in the works! This new version will give you even more insights about your deployed business processes, especially in the context of continuous monitoring. There are a lot of features to be built for Optimize 2.0 so don't be alarmed if there is no new Camunda Optimize release in the next months.

We are proud to announce the latest release of Camunda Optimize! With version 1.5.0 we fixed several bugs and made usability improvements that help you make informed decisions in order to optimize your processes. Check out our [documentation](https://docs.camunda.org/optimize/) and [get in touch with us](https://camunda.com/about/contact/) to find out how you can use Camunda Optimize to improve your processes.

# Great Things are Coming

The next major version of Camunda Optimize is in the works! This new version will give you even more insights about your deployed business processes, especially in the context of continuous monitoring. There are a lot of features to be built for Optimize 2.0 so don't be alarmed if there is no new Camunda Optimize release in the next months.

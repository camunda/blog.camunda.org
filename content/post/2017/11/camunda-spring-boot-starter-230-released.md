We are excited to announce the first officially supported release of the Camunda Spring Boot Starter - v. 2.3.0. 

Camunda Spring Boot Starter makes it super easy to include a ready-to-use, preconfigured Camunda engine in your Spring Boot application. It offers a very convenient 
way to adjust the most used configuration settings, but still allows to use the full power of configuration for experienced users.

The current release does not implement new features. Is mostly concentrates on including the project in the Camunda development lifecycle:

- The project will continue to be maintained in the existing [repository on Github](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-spring-boot-starter).
- Issues are now tracked in the [Camunda Jira](https://app.camunda.com/jira/browse/CAM)
- Documentation from now on can be found on the [Camunda docs page](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.8/user-guide/spring-boot-integration/), including a [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.camunda.org/get-started/spring-boot/).
- Most common usage scenarios are demonstrated in [Examples](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-examples/tree/master/spring-boot-starter).

Camunda Spring Boot Starter 2.3.0 relies on Camunda BPM Platform 7.8 by default. You can find the Upgrade guide [here](https://stage.docs.camunda.org/manual/7.8/update/spring-boot-starter/migration-22-23/).

## Success Path

Up to version 2.2.0, Camunda Spring Boot Starter used to be a community extension, a very successful one <img src="Rocket_Emoji.png" width="23" height="23">. 
Now we're happy to adopt the codebase and make those who use it even more happy!

Once again, we would like to thank [Oliver Steinhauer and the many other contributors](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-spring-boot-starter/graphs/contributors), who have made the spring boot 
starter into what it is today. In particular, we also want to thank [Jan Galinski](https://twitter.com/jangalinski) from Holisticon, who not only contributed a lot to this project in the past, 
but also took the time to visit us in our Berlin office to review the codebase with us and help us take over responsibility for it.

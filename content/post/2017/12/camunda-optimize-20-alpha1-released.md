Updated aggregations allow you to view either count of process and activities or
 their durations grouped by process instance start date intervals or flow nodes
 frequency. Which can be represented in one of following ways:

* Number
* Table
* Bar chart
* Area line chart
* Pie chart
* Heatmap
* JSON Dump

Once you have prepared all reports with insights of your data you can now assemble
them into Dashboards. Each dashboard consists of one or more reports placed on
an infinite grid.

Here is a summary of how the Camunda company did in 2017. I hope you'll enjoy reading it as much as I did writing it.

# Financials

For our revenue growth 2013-2016, we've already been awarded by Deloitte as one of the 50 fastest growing tech companies in Germany, and one of the 500 fastest in EMEA.

This year, we accelerated even more and grew the Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) by 80%. 

We are still fully profitable and self-funded, despite the fact that we grew our staff to a total of 70 employees and opened two offices in the US.

# Customers

 We signed up many new customers, among them impressive names such as PricewaterhouseCoopers. Generally speaking, we're seeing more and more big organizations adopting Camunda for core process automation, especially in the US finance industry. 

But we also welcomed some unusual customers, like the government of Catalunya (known for their struggle with the Spanish government), or Complia, a Denver-based startup that builds compliance software for the legalized marijuana industry. 

My personal highlight this year was the presentation given by Galen Hollins, who explained how [NASA uses Camunda to support their space missions](https://vimeo.com/236067860).

# Product Innovation

In April, we won the [bpmNEXT Award](http://bpmnext.com) - for the second year in a row. 

In May, we released Camunda 7.7 with significant improvements. In June, we published [Cawemo](https://cawemo.com), our very first SaaS product, that sports more than 5,000 users by now. In July, we launched [Zeebe](https://zeebe.io), an entirely now workflow technology (that brought us the aforementioned award) as an open source project, and we released [Optimize](https://camunda.com/products/optimize/), a web app that combines big data analytics with workflow automation. Then we caught our breath for a few months, before releasing Camunda 7.8 in November, as always right on schedule. 

In between, we constantly improved the [Camunda Modeler](https://camunda.com/products/modeler/) and the underlying [bpmn.io](https://bpmn.io) libraries, did a hackathon that produced things like a [VR experience for BPMN](https://twitter.com/CamundaBPM/status/911199602925293570) and still found the time to do what <i>really</i> matters:

# What's next?

It's hard to imagine how we could surpass such a year. However, I truly believe that 2018 will be even greater for Camunda.

I am convinced that we are witnessing the emergence of a new market, and that is because all markets start with a problem. In this case, the problem results out of the economy's digital transformation. This transformation has initially lead to the big data problem - and the respective market. The next logical, inevitable stage is the "big workflow problem": How can we handle activity chains that are complex, distributed, long-running and mission-critical? How can we handle them on a <i>massive</i> scale? 

This problem has three critical dimenions: Software development, technical operations and business visibility. I am not yet seeing anyone who is able to solve that problem in all three dimensions to a sufficient extend. At the same time, the relevance of this problem is magnitudes larger than, say, the problem that is solved by Robotic Process Automation, and the pain is way more tangible and near-term than the one that Artificial Intelligence is supposed to cure. 

Camunda is in a pole position to become a leader in this new category, and I am very much looking forward to 2018 :)

# Thank you

You could think that our team was freaking out during this crazy year, with 80% growth and all that. But in fact everyone was just focused, efficient and nevertheless excited. I think it is important to keep a cool head and stay humble, and I am grateful that I can work with people who love to be successful without becoming too cocky.

Any company, in fact any group of people that strives to achieve something extraordinary, depends on people who combine great talent with full dedication. You can find this combination at Camunda, to an extend that I believe is above average even for a tech startup. At the same time, those people are friendly, funny and just great to have around, every day. 

My thanks go to the people at Camunda and their families, as well as to our customers and partners. 

Happy New Year! 

P.S.: In the middle of winter, it's good to remember there was summer once and it will be there again. This video helps me a lot :)

The following classes are given:

- Camunda BPM for Java Developers
- Camunda and Microservices
- BPMN 2.0 Training

If you are a software developer or architect eager to start coding, you'll be most probably interested in our "Camunda BPM for Java Developers" or "Camunda and Microservices" training.
The agenda of these trainings is comparable and enables you to start with your first project immediately.
They cover all the nitty gritty details of how Camunda BPM automates BPMN-diagrams and contain a ton of hands-on exercises so that you experience how everything works together.

"Camunda BPM for Java Developers" has its focus on Java Developers, both the more "classical" enterprise software development with application servers, but also cloud-native development with frameworks like Spring Boot

"Camunda and Microservices" focuses on distributed systems communicating via Rest, events or message busses and Camunda BPM is "just" one player, either as part of one service or acting as an orchestrator.

Being more on the business side of things, or a technical person interested in comprehensive understanding of BPMN 2.0 and how it can help to express the needs of your workflows and business processes, the course "BPMN 2.0 Training" is tailored for you.
It enables you to read each and every diagram ever made in BPMN 2.0 since we introduce every symbol and its semantic to you.
Additionally, you learn approaches how to apply BPMN 2.0 in a meaningful way and we tackle questions like "which processes are worth to be modeled in detail, where is an abstract view sufficient?".

The trainings are scheduled two weeks after CamundaCon Live for participants in American time-zones, and three weeks after CamundaCon Live for participants in European or Asian time zones.

Due to the current Corona virus situation these trainings are, of course, held remotely.
To not overstrain your eyes and ears with 8 hour zoom sessions, the courses are scheduled:

- 5 hours per day
- split into a morning and an afternoon session
- over 5 days.

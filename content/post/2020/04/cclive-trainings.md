At [CamundaCon Live](https://www.camundacon.com/live/), you'll learn a lot about the Camunda product stack and how our solutions help all kinds of companies to apply process and workflow automation to really accelerate their digital transformation.

So, after CamundaCon Live, you might be feeling highly motivated and cannot wait to fling yourself into your next (or perhaps very first) Camunda project?
In that case we want to support you as best as we can to underscore your Camunda knowledge with profound modeling and technical insight.
Therefore we've just released a special offer for our upcoming remote classroom trainings, which gives you up to 50% discount on the standard price.

We offer three types of training:

- **Camunda BPM for Java Developers**
- **Camunda and Microservices**
- **BPMN 2.0 Training**

If you are a software developer or architect eager to start coding, you'll be most probably interested in our Camunda BPM for Java Developers or Camunda and Microservices training. The agendas of these trainings are comparable and enable you to start with your first project immediately. They cover all the nitty gritty details of how Camunda BPM automates BPMN-diagrams and contain a ton of hands-on exercises so that you experience how everything works together.

Camunda BPM for Java Developers focuses on Java Developers, both the more "classical" enterprise software development with application servers, but also cloud-native development with frameworks like Spring Boot.

Camunda and Microservices focuses on distributed systems communicating via REST, events or message busses and Camunda BPM is "just" one player, either as part of one service or acting as an orchestrator.
No Java skills required, you can use your favorite language(s).

If you're working on the business side of things, or a technical person interested in getting a comprehensive understanding of BPMN 2.0 and how it can help to express the needs of your workflows and business processes, the course: BPMN 2.0 Training, is tailored for you.
It enables you to read each and every diagram ever made in BPMN 2.0, as we'll introduce every symbol and its meaning.
Additionally, you'll learn how to apply BPMN 2.0 in a meaningful way and we tackle questions like "Which processes are worth modeling in detail?" and "Where is an abstract view sufficient?".

The trainings are scheduled two weeks after CamundaCon Live for participants in American time-zones, and three weeks afterwards for participants in European and Asian time-zones.

Due to the current situation with COVID-19, these trainings are held remotely and have been completely adapted for a fun and engaging virtual experience:

- 5 hours per day, over 5 days
- split into a morning and an afternoon session

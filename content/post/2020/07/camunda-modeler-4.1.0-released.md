## New Decision Table Layout

Being able to reason about your decision tables without having to dig into details is crucial. As part of our ongoing effort to make the DMN editor an even better tool, we're introducing changes to the decision table layout to increase overall readability and, therefore, understandability. 

These changes include more information about inputs and outputs and referring to the selected hit policy using their full name.

Furthermore, you can now resize decision table columns. Once you change a column's width, it will be remembered when re-opening the decision table.

Since this release introduces quite significant changes to the DMN editor we would love to hear your feedback.


## Navigating DMN Diagrams

When working with complex DMN diagrams being able to navigate efficiently is crucial. We introduced a new means of navigating the DRD diagram elements without having to go back and forth between DRD and DRG element view.

When working on a single decision table or literal expression, you can resize the overview or close hide it.

## Usage Statistics

If you want to help us make the Camunda Modeler an even better product, you can now enable it to send usage statistics. No statistics will be sent without your permission. Go to `Help > Privacy Preferences` to enable and disable this feature.

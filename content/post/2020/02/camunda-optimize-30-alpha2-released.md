# Enhanced User Task Monitoring and Reporting

Optimize 3.0.0-alpha2 includes new User Task Monitoring and Reporting capabilities.

Up to this point when monitoring the distribution of User Tasks across Assignees or Candidate Groups, it was only possible to see the number or duration of each User Task per Assignee or Candidate Group:

This release adds the possibility to group by Flow Node and distribute by Assignee or Candidate Group. The resulting report could look like this:
{{< figure src="usertask-report2.png" alt="User Task Group by Flow Node distribute by Assignee" >}}

This report can help to get a good overview about the distribution of each User Task across different Assignees or Candidate Groups and makes Optimize's User Task Reporting capabilities even stronger.

# Improved Dashboard Handling

In addition to the new reporting capabilities, this release also improves the way you can work with dashboards. When adding a report to a dashboard other reports automatically make space for the report. Especially in dashboards that contain many reports this improvement simplifies dashboard interactions a lot.

# Support for Elasticsearch 7.6

From this version on, Elasticsearch 7.0.x - 7.6.x is now officially supported.

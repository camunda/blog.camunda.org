# Enhanced User Task Monitoring and Reporting

With Optimize 3.0-alpha1 we made further enhancements to the User Task Monitoring and Reporting capabilities.

When monitoring the distribution of User Tasks or analyzing durations of User Tasks so far unassigned User Tasks were not visible in Reports.
The number of unassigned User Tasks and duration of those can be very relevant when monitoring or analyzing User Task Performance.

Therefore we have added Unassigned User Tasks to all relevant reports per default.
There is no additional work needed from your side.

The following example shows all User Tasks of a Process grouped by assignes:

Additionally, it is also possible to look at the same information, but distributed by the specific User Tasks.
This allows to easily identify how many User Tasks are unassigned currently.

# Enhanced Date Filters

With this release we add more capabilities to our date filters and also improve the usability of the existing functionality.

Before this release there were two different approaches for filtering on dates. Either you filter on a fixed date period or you would look at a relative time period from today in the past.

One functionality that was missing is the selection of instances that were started or ended in a certain period of time - but relative to the evaluation date of the report itself.

We have added this functionality by reworking the Date Filter for Start and End Date of Process Instances completely.

This means you can now select all the process instances that have been started last quarter by just two clicks.

## Fixed Period

Example: Show me all process instances start have been start in January 2020.

## Rolling Period

Example: Show me all process instances that have been started this month.

{{< figure src="date-filter-rolling.png" alt="Camunda" >}}

## Relative Period

Example: Show me all process instances that have been started in the past 30 days.

{{< figure src="date-filter-relative.png" alt="Camunda" >}}



# Support for Elasticsearch 7

With this release we are adding official support for Elasticsearch 7 - more precisely 7.0.x, 7.1.x, 7.2.x, 7.3.x, 7.4.x, and 7.5.x.
At the same time we are not longer supporting Elasticsearch 6.
If you are currently running Optimize in production, it is of course possible to easily upgrade from Elasticsearch 6 to Elasticsearch 7.

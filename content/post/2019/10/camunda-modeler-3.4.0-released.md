## Improved Deployment Experience

Camunda Modeler v3.4 comes with an improved deployment experience for its users. The built-in Deployment Plugin will now automatically check if the engine backend is accessible or not before the deployment process. In addition, the Deployment Plugin is also now capable of remembering the deployment details per diagram. We believe this will make things much easier for our users as the deployment feature is meant to be used repeatedly.

Another additional improvement is the display of Camunda Engine related parse errors. Camunda Modeler now displays validation errors in human-readable format so that the users can fix them easily.

## Extension Point for UI Plugins

It is now possible for Camunda Modeler plugins to have access to UI elements such as toolbar and modals. To make things easier during plugin development process, we also made access to workspace configurations possible for plugins to be able to save and restore their states. In addition to this, we introduced [several application events to hook into](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-modeler/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#plugins).

A good example for a UI Plugin is our built-in Deployment feature.

extension points, may be subject to change in the future. Don't forget to check our [Plugin documentation](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-modeler/tree/develop/docs/plugins) out.

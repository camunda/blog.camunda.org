<!-- FEATURES EXPLANATIONS BEGIN -->

## Fine-Grained Operator Permissions

Cockpit is the swiss army knife for your process operations. It provides the transparency to identify problems and empowers your operators to react whenever necessary. When you run critical business processes with Camunda, avoiding unwanted modifications to your data is important. That's why 7.11 adds new permissions that let you give your users exactly those permissions that they need to perform their task best.

{{< figure class="teaser no-border" src="1-authorizations.png" alt="operator-permissions" caption="Giving an operator the permissions to retry jobs and suspend process instances">}}

You can now control if a user can:

* Retry jobs
* Suspend process instances and definitions
* Create a batch of a specific type
* Read runtime and historic process variables
* Change process variables

Read on:

* [Glossary of Permissions](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.11/user-guide/process-engine/authorization-service/#permissions-by-resource)

## Track All Changes Made by Operators and Administrators

To improve transparency of who did what, *all* operations that can be performed in Cockpit, Tasklist and Admin are now included in the user operation log.

On top of that, Camunda enterprise edition ships two audit log dashboards that let you browse and search this data. In Cockpit, all task-related and operative actions can be inspected:

{{< figure class="teaser no-border" src="2-audit-log-cockpit.png" alt="operator-permissions" caption="See a log of all operative actions in Cockpit">}}

In Admin, all administrative actions such as creating users or granting permissions can be viewed:

{{< figure class="teaser no-border" src="3-audit-log-admin.png" alt="operator-permissions" caption="See a log of all administrative actions in Admin">}}

* [Glossary of Logged Operations](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.11/user-guide/process-engine/history/#glossary-of-operations-logged-in-the-user-operation-log)

## More APIs Return Variables

This release introduces additional APIs that trigger a process instances and return variables. What was already possible for [starting process instances](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.11/user-guide/process-engine/process-engine-concepts/#variables-in-return) is now also available for completing tasks, submitting task forms and correlating messages. For task completion, the API looks as follows:

```java
TaskService taskService = ...;
Task task = ...;

VariableMap processInstanceVariables = taskService
    .completeWithVariablesInReturn(task.getId(), null, false);
```

The return value contains the resulting state of process instance variables before the call returns. This lets your processes synchronously communicate results to the caller. For example, consider the following process:

{{< figure class="teaser no-border" src="4-variables-in-return.png">}}

With the new API, you can immediately obtain the computed total as a result of completing the task and display it to the user.

* REST API: [Complete a Task](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.11/reference/rest/task/post-complete/), [Submit a Task Form](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.11/reference/rest/task/post-submit-form/), [Correlate a Message](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.11/reference/rest/message/post-message/)

## Change the Removal Time of Historical Data

When you use [history cleanup](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.11/user-guide/process-engine/history/#history-cleanup), every historic process instance has its own [removal time](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.11/user-guide/process-engine/history/#instance-removal-time) which is the time after which it will be removed to free up space in your database. You can now change the removal time of single or many instances at once:

{{< figure class="teaser no-border" src="5-removal-time-batch.png">}}

You have the options to set an arbitrary removal time, to let the engine re-compute the removal time based on the current time-to-live settings, or to clear the removal time. Clearing will prevent the data to be removed at all, so you can keep historic data of selected instances indefinitely.

Hint for anyone migrating from 7.9: This feature lets you assign a removal time to data that was created with Camunda versions <= 7.9, so that they are covered by removal-time-based history cleanup.

Read on:

* [History Cleanup](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.11/user-guide/process-engine/history/#history-cleanup)
* [Java API to Set Removal Time](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.11/user-guide/process-engine/batch-operations/#set-a-removal-time)

## Trigger BPMN Errors from Execution and Task Listeners

With this release, [BPMN Error events](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.11/reference/bpmn20/events/error-events/) can be triggered from [execution and task listeners](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.11/user-guide/process-engine/delegation-code/#execution-listener). Consider the following process:

{{< figure class="teaser no-border" src="6-bpmn-errors.png">}}

We can implement an execution listener on the `end` event of the *Receive Payment* activity that validates the received funds:

```java
public class ValidatePaymentListener implements ExecutionListener {

  @Override
  public void notify(DelegateExecution execution) throws Exception {
    int billedAmount = (int) execution.getVariable("billedAmount");
    int receivedAmount = (int) execution.getVariable("receivedAmount");

    if (receivedAmount < billedAmount) {
      throw new BpmnError("insufficient-payment");
    }
  }
}
```

In case the error is raised, the catching boundary event triggers and a human can clarify the case.

* [Implementing BPMN Error Events](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.11/reference/bpmn20/events/error-events/)

## Fluent Java Testing API

[camunda-bpm-assert](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-assert) has become part of the Camunda product. With this library, writing unit tests for your BPMN processes becomes a breeze:

```java
// Given we create a new process instance
ProcessInstance processInstance = runtimeService().startProcessInstanceByKey("testProcess");
// Then it should be active
assertThat(processInstance).isActive();
// And it should be the only instance
assertThat(processInstanceQuery().count()).isEqualTo(1);
// And there should exist just a single task within that process instance
assertThat(task(processInstance)).isNotNull();

// When we complete that task
complete(task(processInstance));
// Then the process instance should be ended
assertThat(processInstance).isEnded();
```

This project has been a popular community extension for many years. We thank the [maintainers of the community extension](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-assert#credits) for all their work!

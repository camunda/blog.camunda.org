Do you run a Joomla based blog or website, and would you like to display diagrams in your posts? You could draw those diagrams somewhere, export them as PNG, JPEG etc. and insert them in your post. But that is not very handy, especially when the diagrams are a bit bigger and people can’t read them anymore. MINAUTICS offers a solution!

On August 25th, 2016 MINAUTICS published an easy to install Extension for Joomla!3 based on the bpmn.io rendering toolkit through which you may create a module displaying bpmn, cmmn, dmn-files.

_You don’t know what bpmn.io is? Read on!_

The plugin enables you to upload and display compliant BPMN or CMMN or DMN XML files. Now you need to create such a file. There are many tools out there that allow you to do that. The easiest way is to go to [http://bpmn.io](http://bpmn.io)

You have just opened the demo app of bpmn.io, the very same project that also powers the Joomla plugin. Once you’re done with your diagram, hit the download button. It will save your diagram as BPMN 2.0 compliant XML in your download folder.

## Upload BPMN file in your Joomla Media Repository

Upload your file to your media folder and then create a new joomla bpmn.io Viewer-module. Select the file you’ve just uploaded and leave the rest as it is for now. The diagram will be referenced as soon as you hit “Save” and shown at your selected module position.

## Insert BPMN diagram in your blog post

Once you created a module you can also include them in your Joomla articles. Hit the module-button in your wysiwyg-editor and the module will be included into your article.
When you publish (or preview) your blog post, you can zoom in and out the diagram by hovering over it and using your mouse wheel. You can also move it inside the window where it is rendered (click and hold and drag).

This plugin was created based on the bpmn.io rendering toolkit which is open source and free to use under the bpmn.io-license. Anyway for maintenance we ask you for a small fee as little as 2,40 EUR. This will enable us to keep it up to date as Joomla-Version ascend and bugs occur.

By the way: There is also a Wordpress-Plugin available.

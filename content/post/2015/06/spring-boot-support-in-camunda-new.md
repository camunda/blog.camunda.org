I am very, very excited about this: the Camunda community now actively collaborates around providing support for Spring Boot.<br />
<br />
This is extremely cool and allows users to deploy Camunda process engine including the Rest Api and the Webapplication in <a href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/">Spring Boot</a>.<br />
<br />
The project is in a very early stage, if you want to participate, join the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=&hl=en#!topic/camunda-bpm-dev/sV0sg7-4Hyo">ongoing discussion on the dev list</a> and checkout the <a href="https://github.com/camunda/camunda-spring-boot-starter">sources in GitHub</a>!<br />
<br />
Many thanks to Oliver Steinhauer who provided an initial implementation that the community decided to collaborate around.

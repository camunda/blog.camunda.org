We created a [Get Started Guide](https://docs.camunda.org/get-started/dmn11/) for Developers who are new to DMN. It guides you through modeling the below DMN 1.1 decision table and execute it with the Camunda BPM Platform.

<!--more-->

You will learn how to:

* create a decision table with the Camunda Modeler
* set up an Apache Maven-based process application inside Eclipse
* evaluate a decision table using the Java Code
* deploy a process application to Apache Tomcat and verify the result in Cockpit
